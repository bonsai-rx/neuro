# Bonsai for Neuroscientists

[![](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/bonsai-rx/neuro/build.yml?branch=main&style=flat-square&label=Deployment%20status)](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/neuro/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This website is a resource and textbook for teaching how to build computational and analytical tools for Neuroscience and Psychology research using [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/).

Bonsai is part of a broader ecosystem of open-source science tools designed to be accessible, understandable and modifiable. We want researchers and students to be able to understand how these tools work, so they can confidently recombine and repurpose technology to answer their genuine experimental questions, as opposed to having these questions constrained by the arbitrary capabilities of pre-existing "black boxes".

To do this we invite you in these pages to imagine, create, and teach technology together.
